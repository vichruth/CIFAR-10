Title: CIFAR-10 Image Classification Project

Description:
This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. Built as part of an assignment for Kalkini, the model is designed to achieve improved accuracy and reduced loss through advanced deep-learning techniques.

Key Features:
✅ Trained and validated on the CIFAR-10 dataset (60,000 images across 10 classes).
✅ Utilized data augmentation for better generalization.
✅ Improved accuracy with Batch Normalization, Dropout, and a Learning Rate Scheduler.
✅ Evaluates model performance using accuracy and loss metrics.

Technologies Used:

Python

TensorFlow & Keras

NumPy

Outcome:
The optimized model achieves a higher accuracy and lower loss by applying advanced CNN architecture and optimization techniques.
